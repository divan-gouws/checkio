You should try to trick by writing a program to calculate the sum of numbers.\nGiven a list of numbers, you should find the sum of these numbers. Your solution should not contain any of the banned words, even as a part of another word.\nThe list of banned words are as follows:\n- sum\n- import\n- for\n- while\n- Reduce\n\nInput: A list of numbers.\n\nOutput: The sum of numbers.\n\nExample:\n```\n\tcheckio([1, 2, 3]) == 6\n\tcheckio([2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]) == 12\n```\n\t\n### How it is used \nThis task challenges your creativity to come up with a solution to fit this mission's specs!\n\n### Precondition: \nThe small amount of data. Let's creativity win!\n\nhttps://github.com/Bryukh-Checkio-Tasks/checkio-task-forbidden-sum.git","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-0f4973d9-3ea4-46cb-a066-93614bc5b155"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-aab32099-74a7-4ff5-a43b-999442e05d74"},"source":"def checkio(data):\n    size = len(data)\n    if (size == 0):\n        return 0\n    else:\n        return data[size-1] + checkio(data[0:size-1])\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"orig_nbformat":2,"deepnote_notebook_id":"c1cb288d-3967-4bb3-99c3-cc7fd82ab249","deepnote_execution_queue":[]}}
