{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Problem URL : https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/count-consecutive-summers/\n\nDifficulty rating : Simple\n\n## Problem statement\n\nPositive integers can be expressed as sums of consecutive positive integers in various ways. For example, 42 can be expressed as such a sum in four different ways:\n1. 3+4+5+6+7+8+9, \n2. 9+10+11+12, \n3. 13+14+15 and \n4. 42. \n\nAs the last solution (d) shows, any positive integer can always be trivially expressed as a singleton sum that consists of that integer alone.\n\nCompute how many different ways it can be expressed as a sum of consecutive positive integers.\n\nInput: Int\n\nOutput: Int\n\nExample:\n```\n\tcount_consecutive_summers(42) == 4\n\tcount_consecutive_summers(99) == 6\n```\n\n### Precondition: \nInput is always a positive integer.\n\nhttps://github.com/oduvan/checkio-mission-count-consecutive-summers","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00000-3a1347fe-f90e-4899-86d3-be7b57b2f20a"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"00001-2369727d-3728-4a86-a42e-acf9d4d1213d"},"source":"# this solution splits a uniform median into odd and even cases\ndef count_consecutive_summers(num):\n    summer_count = 0\n    print(num)\n    for factor in range(1, num + 1):\n        factor_complement = float(num) / float(factor)\n        if (factor_complement - (factor / 2) > 0):\n            if ((factor % 2 == 1) and (factor_complement - int(factor_complement) == 0)):\n                summer_count = summer_count + 1\n            if ((factor % 2 == 0) and (factor_complement - int(factor_complement) == 0.5)):\n                summer_count = summer_count + 1\n    return summer_count\n            \n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    print(\"Example:\")\n    print(count_consecutive_summers(42))\n\n    # These \"asserts\" are used for self-checking and not for an auto-testing\n    '''\n    assert count_consecutive_summers(42) == 4\n    assert count_consecutive_summers(99) == 6\n    assert count_consecutive_summers(1) == 1\n    '''\n    count_consecutive_summers(42)\n    count_consecutive_summers(99)\n    count_consecutive_summers(1)\n    \n    print(\"Coding complete?
